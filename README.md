This is a modified version of the M3D-Fio plugin that bypasses the dimension check routine, so we can use the G-code file that we get from other slicing software. All the rights of the program are with donovan6000. 
<br>
You can install it with OctoPrint's built in plugin manager. The URL for that is '<a href="https://github.com/neoxharsh/M3D-Fio/archive/master.zip">https://github.com/neoxharsh/M3D-Fio/archive/master.zip</a>' or you can install it manually with the command 'pip install https://github.com/neoxharsh/M3D-Fio/archive/master.zip'

<br>
If you are using Linux, the 90-m3d-local.rules needs to applied in order to avoid issues. You can apply it like this:
<br>
mv ./90-m3d-local.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
<br>
sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart
